      <p>Bodhidharma performed the great service of spreading the form of meditation he practiced to China, which, over time, has spread across the world.  This form of meditation, now generally associated with Zen Buddhism, focuses on realizing that all of the phenomena in existence came into being due to the activity of the mind, and that the way to achieve “Noble Wisdom” is by transcending the mind.</p>

      <p>When Bodhidharma named Hui Ke his successor, he gave him his copy of the Lankavatāra Sutra and told him that everything he needed to know was in that text.  One message that appears repeatedly in the Lankavatāra is this same point that true spiritual attainment is achieved by transcending the mind.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <q>Mahāmati, I do not teach anything approaching the discrimination of the philosophers.  For what reason?  Because there are no external objects, there is nothing to get attached to; when one abides in Mind-only, beyond which there is no external world, dualism ceases; as there is no realm of form based on discrimination, one comes to recognize that there is nothing but what is seen of the Mind itself; and for these reasons the discrimination of what is seen of the Mind itself does not take place.  Owing to the cessation of discrimination, one enters into the triple emancipation where is the state of no-form, emptiness, and effortlessness.  Hence it is called deliverance.</q>
        <cite>- Lankāvatāra Sutra</cite>
      </div>

      <p>The true meaning of Zen is what lies at the heart of every spiritual tradition: the discovery of what we really are.  Investigating our own existence by investigating the mind is, in the opinion of the author, not only the most fascinating subject in the world, but also the most rewarding, for it leads to liberation from suffering and that which everyone seeks: permanent happiness.  Suffering arises from the mind, so freedom from the mind and its habit energies naturally leads to freedom from suffering.  No fancy rituals or special trinkets are needed for this investigation; all that is required is to carry out the practice.</p>

      <p>While Bodhidharma is credited with sparking the spread of this Mind-only approach in East Asia, he was not the first to teach it.  Indeed, Bodhidharma was simply spreading the teachings of the Buddha, whose teachings on the mind are well documented in Buddhist sutras.  Even before the lifetime of Shakyamuni Buddha, deep investigation of the mind was practiced.  There are particularly strong parallels between Bodhidharma’s Mind-only approach and the Advaita Vedanta tradition.  Consider these quotes from the Ribhu Gita, one part of the Shiva Rahasya Purana:</p>

      <div class="quote">
      	<q>The total discarding of the mind is alone victory, achievement, bliss, yoga, wisdom and liberation. The sacrifice of the mind is, in fact, the totality of all sacred sacrifices.</q>
      	<cite>- Ch.15, v.7</cite>
  	</div>
  	<div class="quote">
      	<q>All worlds and creatures are only thought forms. They are nothing but the mind, which is a bundle of thoughts, which again are nothing more than ripples in the still ocean of Awareness-Self, and certainly nothing apart from that Self. Therefore, one should abide in the firm conviction that all objects are only I Am Self-Brahman.</q>
      	<cite>- Ch.22, v.24</cite>
  	</div>

  	<p>In more recent times, the great Sage Ramana Maharshi (1879 - 1950) expounded the virtues of investigating the mind:</p>

  	<div class="quote">
  		<q>Your business is to know the nature of the mind. Then you will know that there is no mind.</q>
  	</div>
  	<div class="quote">
  		<q>The ultimate truth is so simple, it is nothing more than being in one's natural original state (aware of your awareness). It is a great wonder that to teach such a simple truth, a number of religions should be necessary, and so many disputes should go on between them as to which is the God-ordained teaching. What a pity! Just be the Self (conscious of your consciousness), that is all.</q>
  	</div>
  	<div class="quote">
  		<q>Investigate the nature of the mind (thoughts) and it will disappear. Because of the emergence of thought, you surmise that it has an origin and call that the mind. When you inquire to see what it is, you find there is really no such thing as mind. When the mind has thus vanished, you realize eternal Peace (awareness of awareness).</q>
  	</div>

  	<p>There are no doubt examples to be found in many other sources, but these are sources that the author is more familiar with and are sufficient to get the point across.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that, while Bodhidharma is known for the Mind-only approach in meditation, this does not mean he promoted a dry, secular approach to cultivation.  Indeed, various spiritual traditions assert that the practice of investigating the mind is the quickest way to return to the Divine, not simply a means of strengthening one’s personal mind.  Bodhidharma himself was most certainly a living bodhisattva - a being that has reached enlightenment but postpones final, complete enlightenment in order to stay in the phenomenal realm helping others.  Reaching such a heightened state of existence is not achieved merely by strengthening the mind, but by transcending the mind.</p>

      <p>So the method of Bodhidharma is to see things as they truly are; to investigate the mind and discover that it is ultimately empty.  When the mind is made still and quiet, our true self, our Buddha nature, can shine.</p><br>
