      <p>Bodhidharma performed the great service of spreading the form of meditation he practiced to China, which, over time, has spread across the world.  This form of meditation, now generally associated with Zen Buddhism, focuses on realizing that all of the phenomena in existence came into being due to the activity of the mind, and that the way to achieve “Noble Wisdom” is by transcending the mind. </p>

      <p>When Bodhidharma named Hui Ke his successor, he gave him his copy of the Lankavatāra Sutra and told him that everything he needed to know was in that text.  One message that appears repeatedly in the Lankavatāra is this same point that true attainment is achieved by transcending the mind.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <q>Mahāmati, I do not teach anything approaching the discrimination of the philosophers.  For what reason?  Because there are no external objects, there is nothing to get attached to; when one abides in Mind-only, beyond which there is no external world, dualism ceases; as there is no realm of form based on discrimination, one comes to recognize that there is nothing but what is seen of the Mind itself; and for these reasons the discrimination of what is seen of the Mind itself does not take place.  Owing to the cessation of discrimination, one enters into the triple emancipation where is the state of no-form, emptiness, and effortlessness.  Hence it is called deliverance.</q><br><br>

      <p>The true meaning of Zen is what lies at the heart of every spiritual tradition: the discovery of what we really are.  Investigating our own existence by investigating the mind is, in the opinion of the author, not only the most fascinating subject in the world, but also the most rewarding, for it leads to liberation from suffering and that which everyone seeks: permanent happiness.  Suffering arises from the mind, so freedom from the mind and its habit energies naturally leads to freedom from suffering.  No fancy rituals or special trinkets are needed for this investigation; all that is required is to carry out the practice.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that, while Bodhidharma is known for the Mind-only approach in meditation, this does not mean he promoted a dry, secular approach to cultivation.  Indeed, various spiritual traditions assert that the practice of investigating the mind is the quickest way to return to the Divine, not simply a means of strengthening one’s personal mind.  Bodhidharma himself was most certainly a living bodhisattva.  Reaching such a heightened state of existence is not achieved merely by strengthening the mind, but by transcending the mind.</p>

      <p>So the method of Bodhidharma is to see things as they truly are; to investigate the mind and discover that it is ultimately empty.  When the mind is made still and quiet, our true self - our Buddha nature - can be realized.</p>
