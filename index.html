      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>Bodhidharma was a crown prince that lived in Southern India around the 5th century.  Just like Shakyamuni Buddha, he gave up his royal life and the promise of becoming king to dedicate himself to spiritual cultivation in the Buddhist tradition.  When the life of his mentor was coming to an end, his last request to Bodhidharma was for him to travel to China to spread the genuine teachings of the Buddha.  In short, Bodhidharma followed the request, traveled to China and eventually arrived at the Southern Shaolin temple.  Seeing that the monks were weak and had low energy from meditating for long hours, he taught them what is now known as chi kung to improve their health and boost their energy, enabling them to meditate more effectively.</p>

      <p>While the historical facts regarding the existence of Bodhidharma and what he taught the Shaolin monks is debated by historians, in Shaolin Wahnam we employ the Zen approach of not debating historical details, but instead focus on practicing the arts that are part of Bodhidharma’s legacy.  The arts still practiced today that are generally considered what Bodhidharma taught are “Eight Pieces of Brocade,” “Sinew Metamorphosis,” “Bone Marrow Cleansing,” and Zen.</p>

      <p>In Shaolin Wahnam, these arts are still very much alive and practiced with great efficacy.  As we owe so much to Bodhidharma and the legacy he left behind, this site is intended to be a dedication to him and a source of information for those that are interested in these truly special practices.  In depth biographical information about Bodhidharma is widely available, so this site is focused on the arts themselves, based primarily on the experience of the author and other students and teachers in Shaolin Wahnam.</p>

      <p>Apart from being grateful for what Bodhidharma passed on to us, we can see him as an exemplary model of persistence, dedication and the grit necessary to succeed in whatever endeavor one may choose.  We sincerely thank Bodhidharma, Sifu Wong Kiew Kit, founder of the Shaolin Wahnam Institute, and all the masters before him that have transmitted these arts for our benefit, and the benefit of future generations.</p>
