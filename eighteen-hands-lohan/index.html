      <h2>Eighteen Hands of Lohan</h2>

      <p>The Eighteen Hands of Lohan is a set of excellent chi kung exercises that are useful for total beginners as well as advanced practitioners.  It’s believed that Bodhidharma taught a set of eight exercises now commonly referred to as “Eight Pieces of Brocade,” or “Ba Duan Jin”.  In Shaolin Wahnam, many students might not be aware of the Eight Pieces of Brocade, but almost all are aware of the Eighteeen Hands of Lohan.  This is because the exercises that comprise Eight Pieces of Brocade are included in the Eighteen Hands of Lohan.  Not all of the exercises in Eight Pieces of Brocade are identical to the exercises in Eighteen Hands of Lohan, but, if there are some differences, the overall exercises are similar enough to attain a similar result.</p>

      <p>For example, pictured below on the left is an exercises from the Eight Pieces of Brocade known as “Drawing the Bow to Shoot the Hawk”, and on the right is an exercise from the Eighteen Hands of Lohan known as “Shooting Arrows”.  In these two examples, they are very similar, with only minor differences.</p>
