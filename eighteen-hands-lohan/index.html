      <h2>Eighteen Hands of Lohan</h2>

      <p>The Eighteen Hands of Lohan is a set of excellent chi kung exercises that are useful for total beginners as well as advanced practitioners.  It’s believed that Bodhidharma taught the Shaolin monks a set of eight exercises now commonly referred to as “Eight Pieces of Brocade,” or “Ba Duan Jin”.  In Shaolin Wahnam, many students might not be aware of the Eight Pieces of Brocade, but almost all are aware of the Eighteeen Hands of Lohan.  This is because the exercises that comprise Eight Pieces of Brocade are included in the Eighteen Hands of Lohan.  Over time the exercises in Eight Pieces of Brocade were expanded upon, giving us the Eighteen Hands of Lohan.  Not all of the exercises in Eight Pieces of Brocade are identical to the exercises in Eighteen Hands of Lohan, but, if there are some differences, the overall exercises are similar enough to attain a similar result.</p>

      <p>For example, pictured below is an exercise from the Eight Pieces of Brocade known as “Drawing the Bow to Shoot the Hawk”, and an exercise from the Eighteen Hands of Lohan known as “Shooting Arrows”.  In these two examples, they are very similar, with only minor differences.  Can you spot them?</p>

      <p>Pictured below is another exercise from the Eight Pieces of Brocade known as “Separate Heaven and Earth”, and an exercise from the Eighteen Hands of Lohan known as “Plucking Stars”.  They again are very similar with only minor, though important, differences.</p>

      <p>The Eighteen Hands of Lohan is a fantastic set of exercises, not only because they are enjoyable to perform, but because they can be used to perform everything from “low level” chi kung to “high level” chi kung.  This means that they can be used for a so-called low level purpose, such as overcoming a minor health issue, as well as a high level purpose, such as spiritual cultivation.</p>

      <p>For example, at a “lower level,” the pattern “Carrying the Moon” is an excellent pattern for restoring youthfulness, making a lady look more radiant, and clearing away back pain.  At a “higher level,” Carrying the Moon can be used to assist the internal skill of “Cosmic Shower,” in which a practitioner employs both the physical form and gentle mental visualization to generate  a shower of cosmic energy.  Apart from making the practitioner feel wonderful and peaceful, this skill is highly effective for clearing away spiritual blockages.</p>

      <p>For a person alive today that wants to follow the example of Bodhidharma and cultivate spiritually, practicing patterns from the Eighteen Hands of Lohan is a very practical as well as wise place to start.  These patterns are particularly suitable for improving overall health, clearing away emotional burdens, boosting vitality, experiencing joy in daily life and improving mental clarity.  Starting with this makes for excellent preparation for someone that truly wants to cultivate spiritually, including sitting meditation.</p>

      <p>It’s common for a person to take up an interest in meditation, try it a few times and get turned off from it because they feel so overwhelmed with thoughts.  This makes them conclude that “they are no good at meditation,” so it must not be for them and they give it up.  It’s actually quite expected for this to happen if someone is bogged down with overthinking, emotional imbalances, physical discomfort and low energy levels.  This is why in Shaolin Wahnam sitting meditation is considered an advanced art, for which proper preparations should be made, such as practicing the Eighteen Hands of Lohan.</p>
